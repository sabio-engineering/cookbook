# Our Values

## HOW WE BEHAVE

### Take ownership
Assuming responsibility for the small things – and the big ones.
Our people take accountability for their roles, actions and behaviours.
They manage expectations well and see things through to completion.

### Be there
We work in a fast-paced, complex environment, often working remotely. Our commitment is to be present and mindful of interactions with others. We support each other through our willingness to help in the understanding that we win together.

### Camaraderie
Our people work together towards shared goals, enjoy each other’s company and have fun along the way. We recognise that diversity of talents, opinions and perspectives make teams stronger.

## HOW WE WIN

### Follow the data
Data forms the building blocks of our decisions. It tells us whether we’re succeeding or failing, where we can and should do more - or less. Whether it’s NPS or analytics, data on diversity or sustainability, we find it, we follow it and act on it.

### Own an opinion
Our business relies on expertise, research and hard work because no two customers are the same.
Opinions are our currency. We form them through knowledge and data, debate them, decide and commit, then act on them
to generate value.

### Stay ahead
The world changes quickly. We spend time analysing the market, mastering our craft and the technologies we work with. We perpetually look for ways to automate, optimize, flex and improve keeping our customers at the forefront of digital CX.

## WHAT WE BELIEVE

### No limits
Our people are our business.
There are no boundaries to greatness for us as individuals and as a team. We put people at the centre of everything we do and give everyone the opportunity to grow, learn and develop, to scale great heights.

### Continuous learning
Fulfilment comes from enjoying the work we do and having a path for progression. We believe in providing every opportunity for our people to continuously learn and develop throughout their whole career.

### Build social value
Our aim is to minimise our impact on the environment and support our customers in doing the same for the long-term future of the planet. We believe that the world must work for everyone, support diverse needs and views and deliver social justice and equality.
